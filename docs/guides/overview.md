# Background

Dear partners, we are delighted to announce that we are launching the new LazOP 2\.0! As the market grows, the current features and API defects are becoming blockers for our mutual growth. In order to provider better services and further empower our partners, we've done an upgrade to our current Open API.

With the release of LazOP 2\.0, users will get access to a wide range of platform features and capabilities through API, including promotion tools; Lazada Push; reverse order, product reviews and more. In addition, we've done a lot of optimizations to our existing API features to address the pain points that we collected from users.
